This repository contains Go bindings for the [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) parsing library.

To use this in your Go project, run:

```sh
go get github.com/tree-sitter/go-tree-sitter@latest
```

Example usage:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    tree_sitter "github.com/tree-sitter/go-tree-sitter"
    tree_sitter_javascript "github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-javascript/bindings/go"
)

func main() {
    code := []byte("const foo = 1 + 2")

    parser := tree_sitter.NewParser()
    defer parser.Close()
    parser.SetLanguage(tree_sitter.NewLanguage(tree_sitter_javascript.Language()))

    tree := parser.Parse(code, nil)
    defer tree.Close()

    root := tree.RootNode()
    fmt.Println(root.ToSexp())
}
```

By default, none of the grammars are included in this package.
This way, you can only bring in what you need, but it's at the slight cost of having to call `go get` n times.

In the example above, to fetch the JavaScript grammar, you can run the following:

```sh
go get github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-javascript@latest
```

Due to [bugs with `runtime.SetFinalizer` and CGO](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-nuts/c/LIWj6Gl--es), you must always call `Close`
on an object that allocates memory from C. This must be done for the `Parser`, `Tree`, `TreeCursor`, `Query`, `QueryCursor`, and `LookaheadIterator` objects.
